# &udm=14 Website

Hey all, this is a basic website that allows for very easy searches of Google with the &udm=14 parameter already added. This parameter allows for searches that are AI-free and bereft of knowledge panels, but are buried in Google’s interface. I decided to offer a simple way to reach them. This version of the website does not include a single-line Plausible tracking code included on the production website that is used for anonymized analytics.

Check out [my post about this feature](https://tedium.co/2024/05/17/google-web-search-make-default/), and why it matters. And if you like this project, be sure to [sign up for Tedium](https://tedium.eo.page/udm14-signup).
