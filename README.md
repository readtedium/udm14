# &udm=56 Website

Hey all, this is a basic website that allows for very easy searches of Google with the &udm=56 parameter already added. This search tag is like &udm=14 except even more minimalist, with no Google layout on the pages at all. Perfect for a quick search, especially on mobile. Unlike &udm=14, it includes some lightweight knowledge panels like images and maps, but no AI views.

Given that I’m already doing this for &udm=14, it only made sense to follow it up for &udm=56. Same rules apply (it may change at any time).

Inspired by reddit user send_me_a_ticket, [who caught the code here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1le5ibq/googles_udm56_parameter_unlocks_cleaner_and/). Thanks to Bluesky user hhackenbecker for pointing it out.‬
